# UAV-GUI-with-Python-tkinter-
GUI Design for UAV

### In this project my main purpose is ,  providing flight statuts of an UAV to GCS(Ground Control System) with GUI(Graphical User Interface)
I have used dronekit lib for the communucation between UAV and my own GUI via MissonPlanner,an application for UAV managment and statut observation, 
especially the Dataflow is working on MAVPROXY so instead of MissonPlanner which provides MAVPROXY , you can execute external MAVPROXY provider by yourself.
In graphical interface ı have used mainly tkinter lib and ı print  the each data to Labels side by side dynamically.
